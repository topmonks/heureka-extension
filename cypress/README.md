**Beware** Cypress tests are not run automatically!

**Why?** They are not stable enough.

**Why?** They are not against real websites. Real websites change & break a lot. 

**Why?** The only way how to properly test if the extension works in the real world is to test it in the real world.

**Consequence:** Tests can fail, and it's up to humans to decide if it's caused by the extension or the website (or both)
and how to handle it.
